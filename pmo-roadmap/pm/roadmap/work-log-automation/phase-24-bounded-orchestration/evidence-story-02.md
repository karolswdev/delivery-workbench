# Evidence - WLA-24-02

- **Story:** WLA-24-02 - Compile and validate exact orchestration rules
- **Status:** done
- **Date:** 2026-07-17

## Proof

`dw_pmo.orchestration` now supplies the one pure semantics layer required by
the visual editor and later runtime. The ordinary installed preset compiles
into separate semantic/document hashes, exposes a complete static analysis,
and produces deterministic scheduling waves without creating a run directory,
event, subprocess, check, or agent session.

## Manual diagnostic review

- Inspected the installed reference preset's first wave and confirmed that
  `research-api` and `research-risks` are concurrently eligible, synthesis is
  the fan-in, `repair` is failure-only, and the green path terminates at
  `awaiting-certification`.
- Inspected planted invalid scores for duplicate ids, dangling dependencies,
  cycles, unbounded retry/route/budget values, duplicate and incompatible
  artifacts, path escape, inline shell execution, unknown capability,
  writable workspace mismatch, and commit authority. Every refusal names a
  JSON pointer, stable code, message, and remediation.
- Moved only canvas coordinates and confirmed the semantic hash stayed fixed
  while the document hash changed; changed a runtime prompt and confirmed the
  semantic hash changed.
