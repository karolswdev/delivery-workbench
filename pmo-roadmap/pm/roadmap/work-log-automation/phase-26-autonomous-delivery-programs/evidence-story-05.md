# Evidence - WLA-26-05

- **Story:** WLA-26-05 - Run debates, councils, and meta-verification
- **Status:** done
- **Date:** 2026-07-22

## Proof

### Implementation and review

- `program_deliberation.py` compiles one already-assigned workflow debate and
  organization council into an immutable finite plan. The plan enumerates
  round/stage/role-slot addresses and proves maximum rounds, speakers, starts,
  artifacts, output bytes, tokens, wall time, distinct-principal quorum,
  aggregation, audit, architect boundary, and every verdict route before any
  dispatch can exist.
- Workflow debates now require per-artifact token bounds and separate advance,
  repair, dissent, quorum-loss, and exhaustion routes. Organization councils
  compile majority, weighted, unanimous, or judge aggregation; role weights;
  vetoes; none/sample/full meta-audit; and narrower round/start/artifact/byte/
  token/wall ceilings. Both existing simulations expose the normalized proof.
- The authority-neutral protocol uses a hash-chained caller-owned event list
  with exact `protocol_started`, `speaker_claimed`, `artifact_recorded`,
  `member_replaced`, and `budget_exhausted` families. It starts no driver,
  creates no grant or filesystem store, and writes no repository or roadmap.
  WLA-26-09 can embed these exact transitions behind program-ledger claims.
- Every round executes only declared proposal, critique, rebuttal, and judgment
  receipts. Bodies remain external by bounded hash/reference; durable metadata
  contains byte/token counts, citations, votes, concise judge rationale,
  aggregation, abstention, dissent, replacement, and route. Unknown transcript,
  prompt, artifact-body, or private-reasoning fields refuse.
- Quorum de-duplicates principals. Majority/weight/unanimity is deterministic;
  judge and tie decisions are limited to computed choices; veto, quorum loss,
  checkpoint, repair, redeliberation, and exhaustion can follow only compiled
  routes. A finite redeliberation consumes the next precompiled round and turns
  into exhaustion at the ceiling.
- Restart with an unresolved speaker claim returns the identical claim and
  exact receipt retries are idempotent. The two-round fixture plants another
  restart between rounds and proves no duplicate speaker, vote, or judgment.
  Hash, sequence, identity, time, semantic, or receipt corruption refuses
  replay.
- Sampling/full meta-audit packets bind the exact rubric, evidence, original
  vote/judgment lineage, and deterministic sample. The independent read-only
  meta-verifier emits only uphold/overturn/escalate, preserves the original
  council verdict, cannot write implementation, and cannot convert judgment
  into mechanical fact.
- Story/phase architect packets expose only declared cross-boundary artifacts
  and exact rubric. Architecture results are approve/repair/escalate/veto;
  packet authority explicitly excludes implementation, integration, commit,
  push, and roadmap mutation. Approval retains the already-governed route
  rather than creating authority.
- The wheel and vendored core include the new module and its public exports.
  Package smoke still proves that install/update creates no workflow,
  organization, program, grant, deliberation store, process, or default-mode
  detour.

### Acceptance mapping

- Declared bounded artifacts only: closed submission schema, byte/token and
  citation checks, content-reference receipts, and opaque transcript refusal.
- Complete finite simulation: exact schedule and maximum proof plus council
  ceiling mismatch, workflow/council mismatch, quorum, and route refusals.
- Honest council ledger/projection: consensus, weighted minority dissent,
  abstention, veto, tie checkpoint, quorum loss, replacement, rationale,
  evidence references, and exact resulting route fixtures.
- Verifier-of-verifier: full audit through restart, overturn route, exact rubric/
  evidence/lineage packet, original-verdict preservation, and read-only
  capability assertions.
- Master architect: phase artifact visibility, explicit no-mutation authority,
  and architect-requested repair fixture.
- Recovery/refusal matrix: two rounds, crashes before receipt and between
  rounds, deterministic replay, no duplicate speaker, wall-budget exhaustion,
  unknown content, changed idempotent receipt, and corrupt ledger cases.
