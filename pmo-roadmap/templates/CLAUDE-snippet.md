## Delivery Workbench (PMO rails)

This repository uses Delivery Workbench: an evidence-first commit gate
over a Markdown roadmap under `pm/roadmap/<project>/` (phases, stories,
paired evidence files). Markdown is the source of truth; `.githooks/dw`
is the CLI for everything below. Run `.githooks/dw doctor` if anything
seems miswired. `.githooks/dw-workbench --root .` serves a localhost
web view of the roadmap (browse, health, trace, guarded edit).

Orient before working:

- `.githooks/dw context [project] --compact` — JSON snapshot: issues,
  warnings, next story, per-story trace paths.
- `.githooks/dw next [project]` — the next actionable story
  (exit 0 = found, 2 = nothing actionable, 1 = error; `--json` for a
  machine-readable object).
- `.githooks/dw check [project]` — structural and evidence-content
  lint; greppable `ERROR <path>: <issue>` lines, exit 1 on issues.

Work a story (statuses: backlog | ready | in-progress | blocked | done;
done-synonyms complete/closed/shipped gate identically):

1. `.githooks/dw story status <project> <phase> <story> in-progress`
2. Do the work.
3. Prove it — run the real verification through
   `.githooks/dw evidence capture <project> <phase> <story> -- <command>`
   (records command, exit code, index tree, and output into the story's
   evidence file; screenshots/binaries go under `assets/` next to it).
4. `.githooks/dw story status <project> <phase> <story> done`
   (refuses without evidence).

Commit — every commit passes the gate:

1. Stage everything (`git add …`), THEN generate the contract:
   `.githooks/dw contract new [--story ID] [--consent yes --reasons "…"]
   [--tests-capture <evidence-path>[#ts]]`
   It stamps machine-verified facts (branch, HEAD, index tree, staged
   sample, story IDs); restaging afterwards invalidates it (regenerate
   with `--force`).
2. Honestly verify each rule, then flip every `- [ ]` to `- [x]` in
   `.tmp/CONTRACT.md`. A `--tests-capture` reference pre-checks the
   "Tests ran." box and is re-verified by the gate.
3. `git commit`. Trailers (`PMO-Story`, `PMO-Contract-Digest`) and the
   contract archive under `.git/pmo-contract-archive/<sha>` are
   automatic; the contract survives an aborted commit.

Gate rules the machinery enforces: one story flips done per commit
(bundle only with `.tmp/BUNDLE-OK.md` + one-line rationale), the
flipped story's `evidence-story-NN.md` ships in the same commit, and
evidence never appears or disappears orphaned. Preflight any time with
`.githooks/dw gate [--porcelain]` — it never consumes the contract.
`.githooks/dw verify [<base>..<head> | --all]` re-derives the
structural rules from pushed history alone — audit any range,
no local contract needed.
`.githooks/dw-mcp` serves the same core as MCP tools
(dw_context, dw_next, dw_check, dw_verify, dw_story_status,
dw_evidence_capture, ...) over stdio for MCP-capable agents —
wired via `.mcp.json`; certification is never a tool call
(`docs/mcp.md`).
Never use `--no-verify`; when blocked, read the banner — it names the
rule and the remediation, and includes the exact contract template.

Slash commands (Claude Code, under `.claude/commands/`): `/dw-next`,
`/dw-story-done`, `/dw-contract`, `/dw-adopt`.
